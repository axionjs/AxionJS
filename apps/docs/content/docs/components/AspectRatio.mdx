## Introduction

The `AspectRatio` component is a utility that ensures consistent width-to-height proportions for responsive media like images, videos, or custom layouts. Built with `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` and integrated seamlessly with Next.js’s `Image` component, it provides a robust solution for maintaining proportional content in modern applications.
