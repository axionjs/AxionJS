title: Introduction
description: AxionJS is a revolutionary component system for Next.js that gives you full ownership of your UI code. Built on top of Radix UI primitives with accessibility-first design and AI-powered component generation.
---

**You own your components. We just help you build them better.**

Traditional component libraries lock you into their design decisions and API constraints. You install a package, import components, and hope they fit your needs. When they don't, you're stuck with workarounds, style overrides, or mixing incompatible libraries.

`AxionJS` takes a fundamentally different approach. We give you the actual component code, built on proven foundations, so you can craft exactly what your application needs.

## Core Philosophy

AxionJS is built around these fundamental principles:

- **Code Ownership:** Every component becomes part of your codebase, not a black box dependency.
- **Accessibility First:** Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG compliance out of the box.
- **Intelligent APIs:** Composable interfaces that work predictably across all components.
- **Zero Lock-in:** Components are yours to modify, extend, or completely rewrite.
- **AI-Enhanced:** Custom MCP server integration for intelligent component generation and management.

## Beautiful CLI Experience

Our CLI is built with [Clack](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack) for an exceptional developer experience:

```bash
npx axionjs init
```

```bash
 $npx axionjs init

┌  Welcome to axion.js CLI

## Comprehensive Theme System

Choose from **50+ professionally designed themes** or generate unlimited custom themes with AI:

- **Pre-built Collections:** Modern, Elegant, Vibrant, and Nature-inspired themes
- **AI Theme Generator:** Powered by Google Gemini - describe your vision, get a complete theme
- **Full Customization:** HSL and OKLCH color formats, custom fonts, animations
- **Tailwind Integration:** Works seamlessly with both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4

## You Own The Code

When you add a component with AxionJS, you get the complete source code in your project. This means:

- **Complete Control:** Modify behavior, styling, and functionality without constraints
- **No Version Lock:** Components evolve with your project, not external library updates
- **Deep Understanding:** See exactly how every interaction and animation works
- **Team Alignment:** Your entire team works with the same, visible component implementations

```tsx
// This button is yours - modify it however you need
export function Button({ variant, size, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }))} {...props} />
  );
}
```

## Built on Proven Foundations

Every AxionJS component leverages battle-tested primitives, inspired by and built upon:

- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)** - Unstyled, accessible components for React
- **[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)** - Accessibility and behavior hooks
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** - The design philosophy that inspired our approach

This gives you:

- **Accessibility by Default:** ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support built-in
- **Behavioral Consistency:** Proven interaction patterns that users expect
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Tested across all modern browsers and devices
- **Reduced Complexity:** Focus on your design while we handle the accessibility layer

```tsx
// Accessible dialog with zero extra work
import * as Dialog from "radix-ui";

export function Modal({ children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root {...props}>
      <Dialog.Content className="modal-content">{children}</Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
}
```

## Intelligent Component System

AxionJS components share a unified API philosophy that makes them instantly familiar:

- **Predictable Props:** Consistent naming and behavior patterns across all components
- **Composable Architecture:** Mix and match components to create complex interfaces
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with intelligent autocompletion
- **Design Token Integration:** Seamless integration with your design system variables

## Production-Ready Hooks

Over **30+ custom hooks** for real-world application needs:

```tsx
// Data fetching and state management
const { data, loading, error } = useAPI("/api/users");
const { items, pagination } = usePagination(data, { pageSize: 10 });

// UI interactions
const { copy, copied } = useClipboard();
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
const { isOnline } = useNetworkStatus();

// Form handling
const { register, errors, submit } = useForm(schema);
const { upload, progress } = useFileUpload();
```

## Rich Chart Components

Built on top of [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) with beautiful, customizable designs:

- **Line, Bar, Area Charts** - Interactive and responsive
- **Pie, Donut, Radar Charts** - Perfect for dashboards
- **Combo Charts** - Multiple data series support
- **Real-time Charts** - Live data updates
- **Custom Themes** - Matches your design system

```bash
npx axionjs add line-chart
```

```tsx
<LineChart
  data={salesData}
  xAxis="month"
  yAxis="revenue"
  theme="gradient"
  animate
/>
```

## Pre-built UI Blocks
