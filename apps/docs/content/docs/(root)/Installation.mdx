### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new AxionJS project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx axionjs init
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process with beautiful interactive prompts built with [Clack](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack):

```bash
$ npx axionjs init

### Add Components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx axionjs add button
```

#### Interactive Component Selection

You can also browse and select multiple components interactively:

```bash 
$ npx axionjs add

#### Adding Individual Components

```bash
$ npx axionjs add button
✓ Checking registry.
✓ Updating CSS variables in src\app\globals.css
✓ Installing dependencies.
✓ Created 1 file:
  - src\components\ui\button.jsx
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers title="src/App.tsx"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Full-Stack Components

AxionJS excels at providing complete, production-ready solutions. Here's what happens when you add a full-stack component like a contact form:

```bash
$ npx axionjs add contact-form
✓ Checking registry.
✓ Updating CSS variables in src\app\globals.css
✓ Installing dependencies.
✓ Prisma initialized successfully.
Model for contact-form appended to schema.prisma.
