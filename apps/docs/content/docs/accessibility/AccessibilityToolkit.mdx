## Component Architecture

The toolkit is built around a single main component with integrated functionality:

### AccessibilityUI

The main component that wraps your entire application and provides all accessibility features.

```tsx
import { AccessibilityUI } from '@/components/AccessibilityUI'

function App() {
  return (
    <AccessibilityUI>
      <YourAppContent />
    </AccessibilityUI>
  )
}
```

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | The content to be wrapped by the accessibility provider |

### Key Features

**Floating Trigger Button**
- Fixed position button in bottom-right corner
- Visual indicator when screen reader is active
- Accessible via keyboard navigation

**Responsive Sidebar Panel**
- Slides in from the right
- Fully keyboard accessible
- Organized tabs for different feature categories
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

**Persistent Settings**
- All preferences saved to localStorage
- Settings persist across browser sessions
- Reset functionality to restore defaults

## State Management

The toolkit uses Zustand for state management with the following store structure:

### AccessibilityStore

```tsx
interface AccessibilityState {
  // Panel visibility
  isOpen: boolean
  toggleOpen: () => void

  // Contrast settings
  contrast: ContrastMode
  setContrast: (level: ContrastMode) => void

  // Text and content settings
  textSize: FeatureIntensity
  textSpacing: FeatureIntensity
  lineHeight: FeatureIntensity
  dyslexiaFriendly: boolean
  hideImages: boolean

  // Visual enhancements
  highlightLinks: FeatureIntensity
  saturation: FeatureIntensity
  cursorSize: FeatureIntensity

  // Screen reader
  screenReader: {
    enabled: boolean
    speed: "normal" | "slow"
    volume: number
  }

  // Utility functions
  resetAll: () => void
}
```

### Type Definitions

```tsx
export type FeatureIntensity = "default" | "medium" | "high"
export type ContrastMode = "default" | "inverted" | "dark" | "light"
```

## CSS Implementation

The toolkit applies accessibility features through CSS classes added to the `<html>` element:

### Contrast Classes
- `.contrast-medium` - 150% contrast
- `.contrast-high` - 200% contrast  
- `.contrast-windows-inverted` - Full color inversion
- `.contrast-windows-dark` - Dark mode styling
- `.contrast-windows-light` - High contrast light mode

### Text Enhancement Classes
- `.text-size-medium` - 1.2x text size
- `.text-size-high` - 1.5x text size
- `.text-spacing-medium` - Increased letter/word spacing
- `.dyslexia-friendly` - OpenDyslexic font family

### Visual Feature Classes
- `.highlight-links-medium/high` - Link highlighting with outlines
- `.hide-images` - Hides all images and media
- `.cursor-medium/high` - Enlarged cursor sizes
- `.screen-reader-highlight` - Highlights currently read elements

## Screen Reader Service

The built-in screen reader service provides:

### Automatic Content Reading
- Reads content on hover and focus events
- Intelligent element detection and text extraction
- Support for form elements, links, buttons, and headings

### Text Processing
- Extracts appropriate text from different element types
- Handles ARIA labels and accessibility attributes
- Provides context for interactive elements

### Visual Feedback
- Highlights currently read elements
- Prevents re-reading of the same content
- Smooth transitions between elements

## Keyboard Navigation

The toolkit supports full keyboard accessibility:

### Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+U` (or `Cmd+U`) - Toggle accessibility panel
- `Tab` - Navigate through elements
- `Enter` - Activate focused element
- `Esc` - Close dialogs and panels

### Focus Management
- Proper focus trapping within the accessibility panel
- Clear focus indicators throughout the interface
- Logical tab order for all interactive elements

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and supported browsers:

| Browser | Version | Screen Reader Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | 76+ | ✓ Full support |
| Firefox | 70+ | ✓ Full support |
| Safari | 13.1+ | ⚠︎ Limited speech synthesis |
| Edge | 79+ | ✓ Full support |
| iOS Safari | 13.4+ | ⚠︎ Limited speech synthesis |
| Android Chrome | 76+ | ✓ Full support |

## Performance Considerations

The toolkit is designed for optimal performance:

- **Lightweight**: Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- **Lazy Loading**: Features are only active when needed
- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses React's built-in optimization
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and services

## Accessibility Standards Compliance

## Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines

<Callout type="info">
**Start Early**: Implement accessibility features during development, not as an afterthought.
</Callout>

- Use semantic HTML elements alongside the toolkit
- Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works without the toolkit
- Regular accessibility audits and user testing
- Provide alternative text for images and media

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Callout type="warn">
**Don't Over-rely**: This toolkit enhances accessibility but doesn't replace proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
</Callout>

- Assuming the toolkit covers all accessibility needs
- Not testing with users who have disabilities
- Ignoring mobile accessibility
- Poor color contrast in base design
- Missing focus indicators for custom components

## Customization

### Styling

The toolkit uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by:

```css
/* Custom CSS overrides */
.accessibility-trigger {
  /* Customize the floating button */
  background-color: your-brand-color;
}

.contrast-high {
  /* Modify high contrast settings */
  filter: contrast(250%) brightness(1.1);
}
```

### Adding Custom Features

Extend the toolkit by adding new features to the store:

```tsx
// Add to accessibility-store.ts
interface AccessibilityState {
  customFeature: boolean
  toggleCustomFeature: () => void
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Screen Reader Not Working**
- Check browser compatibility
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for speech synthesis)
- Verify audio is not muted

**Styles Not Applying**
- Confirm CSS is imported in your global styles
- Check for CSS specificity conflicts
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

**Performance Issues**
- Disable features not needed for your application
- Check for memory leaks in custom implementations
- Monitor bundle size impact
